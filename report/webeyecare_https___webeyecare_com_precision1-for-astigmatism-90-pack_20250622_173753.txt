## Recommendations

Based on the PageSpeed Insights data, here's a prioritized list of recommendations focusing on improving site speed and SEO within the BigCommerce platform limitations:

**Prioritization:**

*   **High:** Directly impacts Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/TBT, CLS), SEO, and user experience.
*   **Medium:** Noticeable performance gains, impacts user experience.
*   **Low:** Incremental improvements, best practice adherence.

### 1.  Optimize and Properly Size the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Image (High)**

*   **Problem:** The main product image is consistently identified as a major performance bottleneck on both mobile and desktop.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Implement WebP/AVIF:** Use a CDN or a BigCommerce app that supports serving images in next-gen formats like WebP or AVIF.
    *   **Properly Size Images:** Ensure the image served matches the display size on different devices. The analysis indicates serving a much larger image than necessary. While BigCommerce uses `srcset`, it's not optimally configured. Investigate the theme's image handling and potentially customize it. Consider using the built-in image manager.
    *   **Preload LCP image:** Implement preloading of the LCP image
*   **Rationale:** Directly improves LCP, reduces bandwidth consumption, and enhances user experience. This is the single biggest opportunity for improvement.

### 2.  Reduce Unused JavaScript (High)**

*   **Problem:** Significant amounts of JavaScript are being loaded but not used, especially on mobile.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Theme Audit:** Identify and remove any unnecessary JS files included in the theme. Consult with the theme developer if needed.
    *   **Code Splitting:** If possible, implement code splitting within the theme to only load necessary JS for each page. Check the current theme's JS structure and look for code splitting opportunities.
    *   **Defer Loading:** Defer the loading of non-critical scripts using the `defer` or `async` attributes. BigCommerce theme settings might provide options for this, or manual theme edits might be required.
*   **Rationale:** Reduces TBT and improves First Input Delay (FID), contributing to better user interaction. Also, removes unnecessary code, which leads to lower loading times.

### 3.  Reduce Unused CSS (High)**

*   **Problem:** A large portion of CSS is not used on the page.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Theme Optimization:** Review the theme's CSS files and remove any unused styles. Consider using a CSS coverage tool in Chrome DevTools to identify unused CSS.
    *   **Critical CSS:** Extract and inline the CSS necessary for above-the-fold content. Defer loading the remaining CSS. This may require theme customization.
*   **Rationale:** Reduces page size, improves rendering speed and contributes to the overall increase of the performance score.

### 4.  Address Redirects (Medium)**

*   **Problem:** A redirect is adding unnecessary loading time.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Directly Access Pages:** Ensure that internal links directly point to the final URL, eliminating the redirect.
*   **Rationale:** Improves page load time and reduces server load.

### 5.  Optimize Server Response Time (Medium)**

*   **Problem:** Initial server response time (TTFB) is relatively high.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Ensure a CDN is properly configured to cache content and serve it from geographically closer locations. This is especially critical for images and static assets.
    *   **Hosting Review:** Consider upgrading your hosting plan if server resources are consistently taxed.
*   **Rationale:** Improving TTFB enhances the overall responsiveness of the website and lays a foundation for faster loading of other resources.

### 6.  Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources (Medium)**

*   **Problem:** Render-blocking JavaScript is delaying the initial rendering of the page.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Defer Loading:** Move the identified script (`https://microapps.bigcommerce.com/bodl-events/1.9.4/index.js`) to the end of the `<body>` tag or use the `defer` attribute to prevent it from blocking rendering.
    *   **Review App Usage:** Evaluate the necessity of the script. If it's not critical, consider removing it or finding a more performant alternative.
*   **Rationale:** Unblocking the render path improves FCP, leading to a faster perceived loading experience.

### 7.  Serve images compressed (Low)**

*   **Problem:** Images are not efficiently encoded.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Optimize images:** Use a service like TinyPNG, ShortPixel or similar to compress images.
*   **Rationale:** Improves page size and reduces bandwidth consumption.

### 8.  Modern Javascript (Low)**

*   **Problem:** Legacy Javascript is being served to modern browsers.
*   **Specific Improvements:**
    *   **Check theme settings:** Review the theme's Javascript build process and target modern browsers
    *   **Update the app:** Update to the latest version of the app or replace it with a better performing one.
*   **Rationale:** Lowers javascript payload and improves loading times.

**General Notes for BigCommerce Development:**

*   **Theme Selection:** Choose a BigCommerce theme that is known for its performance and optimization.
*   **App Evaluation:** Carefully evaluate the performance impact of any installed BigCommerce apps. Test performance before and after installation. Remove unused or poorly performing apps.
*   **CDN Configuration:** Ensure your CDN is properly configured to cache static assets, including images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular performance audits using PageSpeed Insights or other tools to identify and address any emerging performance bottlenecks.
