## Recommendations

The following recommendations prioritize improvements based on SEO and UX impact, considering BigCommerce platform constraints.

1.  **Optimize Images (High Impact: Performance, SEO, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** The largest contentful paint (LCP) is the product image, and it's not optimized. The image is significantly larger than necessary, uses an older format (JPEG), and could be more efficiently encoded.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Properly Size Images:** Ensure the main product image served is appropriately sized for the display. The report highlights a 960w image being used on mobile and a 1920w image on desktop, where a smaller image would suffice. Use BigCommerce's image size settings or a third-party image optimization app to automatically resize images based on screen size.
        *   **Implement Next-Gen Image Formats (WebP/AVIF):** While BigCommerce doesn't natively support WebP/AVIF on upload, explore using a CDN (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare) or a BigCommerce app that provides automatic image conversion and delivery in next-gen formats.
        *   **Efficiently Encode Images:** Even within JPEG, ensure images are compressed optimally without sacrificing visual quality.
        *   **Preload LCP Image:** Add a `<link rel="preload">` tag in the `<head>` of the document to prioritize loading the LCP image. Since you cannot directly edit the `<head>`, explore using theme settings or a script injection app to insert this tag.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Check theme settings for image sizing options. Evaluate a CDN or image optimization app. Use a script injection app or theme customization to add the preload tag.

2.  **Reduce Unused JavaScript (High Impact: Performance, SEO, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** A significant amount of JavaScript is unused, contributing to longer loading times and increased TBT.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Analyze and Remove Unnecessary Scripts:** Audit the theme and installed apps to identify JavaScript files that aren't essential for the product page's functionality. Consider removing or replacing them with more efficient alternatives.
        *   **Lazy Load Non-Critical Scripts:** Defer loading of scripts that are not required for the initial page render.  Use the `async` or `defer` attributes in the script tags.  This might require theme modification or using a script management app.
        *   **Code Splitting:** Investigate if the theme or certain apps use code splitting to load only necessary JavaScript for each page. This is more complex but can yield significant performance gains.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Audit installed apps and theme settings. Explore theme customization or advanced apps offering code splitting capabilities.

3.  **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources (Medium Impact: Performance, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** The `microapps.bigcommerce.com/bodl-events/1.9.4/index.js` script is render-blocking, delaying the initial paint of the page.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Defer or Async:**  Determine if this script is critical for initial page rendering. If not, defer its loading using the `defer` attribute in the script tag, or load it asynchronously using the `async` attribute. This likely requires theme modification or using a script management app.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Assess the necessity of this script and implement defer or async loading.

4.  **Address Redirects (Medium Impact: Performance, SEO, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** A redirect from `https://webeyecare.com/precision1-for-astigmatism-90-pack` to `https://webeyecare.com/precision1-for-astigmatism-90-pack/` is adding latency.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Enforce Canonical URL:** Ensure that all internal links and references point to the preferred URL (either with or without the trailing slash). Choose one and stick to it consistently.
        *   **Configure Preferred URL in BigCommerce:** In BigCommerce settings, configure the preferred URL structure (with or without trailing slash).
        *   **Implement a 301 Redirect:** Create a redirect from the non-preferred version to the preferred version, if BigCommerce doesn't handle this automatically.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Check and configure URL settings. Implement 301 redirect using the built-in redirect tool.

5.  **Reduce Unused CSS (Medium Impact: Performance, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** The `__wecproduct_uncritical.css` stylesheet has a large amount of unused CSS.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Identify and Remove Unused Rules:** Analyze the stylesheet to identify and remove CSS rules that are not being used on the product page. This likely requires theme customization and a solid understanding of CSS.
        *   **Consider Critical CSS:** Explore extracting the "critical CSS" (the CSS needed for above-the-fold content) and inlining it directly into the HTML.  Load the remaining CSS asynchronously. This is an advanced technique that requires theme modification or potentially a specialized app.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Consider theme customization by a developer to remove the unused CSS, or find an app with that capability.

6. **Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers (Low Impact: Performance, UX):**

    *   **Problem:** Serving legacy JavaScript adds unnecessary bloat, as the browser can already use modern standards.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Update Theme:** Update the theme with a more modern version to avoid serving legacy JavaScript. 
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Update the BigCommerce theme to a more modern version.

7. **Leverage Text Compression (Low Impact: Performance):**

    *   **Problem:** Text-based resources are not being served with compression (gzip, deflate, or brotli).
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Verify Server Configuration:** Ensure that the server (or CDN) is configured to automatically compress text-based resources before serving them.  Most CDNs handle this automatically.
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Check CDN settings to enable text compression. If using a BigCommerce-hosted store, contact BigCommerce support to verify compression is enabled on their servers.

8.  **Structured Data Markup (Medium Impact: SEO):**

    *   **Problem:** Limited use of structured data.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   **Enhance Product Schema:** Ensure the product schema markup is complete and accurate, including all relevant details such as price, availability, reviews, and product variations.
        *   **Implement Additional Schema Types:** Manually add schema markup for FAQPage (for the product page's FAQ section) and BreadcrumbList (for improved navigation).
    *   **BigCommerce Action:** Manually add structured data to the product description, as needed.

By addressing these recommendations, the client can improve their store's performance, SEO, and user experience within the constraints of the BigCommerce platform. Prioritize image optimization and unused JavaScript reduction, as they have the most significant impact on page speed and Core Web Vitals.
