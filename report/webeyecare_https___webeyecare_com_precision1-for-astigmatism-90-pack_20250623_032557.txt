## Recommendations

Based on the Lighthouse report and considering the limitations of the BigCommerce platform, here's a prioritized list of recommendations:

### High Priority (SEO & UX Impact)

1.  **Optimize and Properly Size Images (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** The largest performance bottleneck on both mobile and desktop is image optimization.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Use a 3rd-party BigCommerce app or CDN that offers automatic image optimization, resizing, and WebP/AVIF conversion (e.g., Akamai Image Manager, Cloudinary, Sirv).
        *   **Action:** Review image sizes within the BigCommerce admin panel and ensure they are appropriately sized for the display area.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves LCP, reduces data usage, and enhances UX.

2.  **Reduce Unused JavaScript (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** Significant amounts of unused JavaScript are being loaded, impacting TBT and overall load time.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Investigate the Searchanise widget and its configuration. Ensure it's only loading when and where it's needed. Consider alternatives if its performance impact is too high.
        *   **Action:** Evaluate the necessity of all third-party scripts loaded through Google Tag Manager (GTM). Remove any unnecessary scripts. Use GTM's trigger options to load scripts only when they are needed.
        *   **Action:** Work with your theme developer to analyze the theme's JavaScript and identify opportunities for code splitting or lazy loading of non-critical modules.
    *   **Rationale:** Reduces TBT, improves interactivity, and contributes to better Core Web Vitals.

3.  **Reduce Initial Server Response Time (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** High server response time (TTFB) for the main document.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Upgrade to a higher-tier BigCommerce plan for more server resources.
        *   **Action:** Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache content closer to users and reduce server load. Ensure the CDN is properly configured to cache HTML pages.
    *   **Rationale:** Improving TTFB directly improves FCP and overall page load time, boosting SEO and UX.

### Medium Priority (SEO Impact)

4.  **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** The `bodl-events/index.js` script is render-blocking.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Defer the loading of this script by adding the `defer` or `async` attribute to its `<script>` tag in the theme's HTML (requires theme customization).
        *   **Action:** Investigate whether this script is essential for above-the-fold content. If not, consider lazy-loading it or removing it entirely.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves FCP and perceived loading speed.

5.  **Address Redirects (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** Redirects are adding unnecessary delays.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Ensure all internal links point directly to the canonical URL (`/precision1-for-astigmatism-90-pack`) and remove any trailing slashes or inconsistencies.
        *   **Action:** Review and clean up any unnecessary redirects configured in the BigCommerce admin panel.
    *   **Rationale:** Reduces page load time and improves crawl efficiency.

6.  **Reduce Unused CSS (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** Significant amounts of unused CSS are being loaded.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Consult with your theme developer to identify and remove unused CSS rules from the `__wecproduct_uncritical.css` file.
        *   **Action:** Consider using a CSS coverage tool to identify unused CSS and then remove or defer those rules.
    *   **Rationale:** Reduces page size and improves rendering speed.

### Low Priority (Minor Performance Gains)

7.  **Efficiently Encode Images (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** Opportunities to further compress images without significant quality loss.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** While a CDN will handle most of this, manually review product images to see if further compression can be applied without sacrificing visual quality.

8.  **Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** JPEGs are being served instead of WebP or AVIF.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Utilize a CDN or BigCommerce app that automatically converts images to WebP or AVIF based on browser support.

9.  **Avoid Serving Legacy JavaScript to Modern Browsers (Mobile & Desktop):**
    *   **Problem:** Serving ES5 code to browsers that support ES6+ can waste bytes.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Work with your theme developer to configure the JavaScript build process to target modern browsers and avoid transpiling baseline features unless legacy browser support is absolutely necessary.

10. **Prioritize LCP Image**
    *   **Problem:** LCP image is not preloaded.
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Action:** Consult with your theme developer to include a `<link rel="preload">` tag in the `<head>` of the document for the LCP image.

These recommendations aim to improve the performance and SEO of your BigCommerce store within the platform's limitations. Focus on the high-priority items first, as they will provide the most significant impact.
